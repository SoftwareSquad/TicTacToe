### Introduction
This document is a design report made for the course Hugbúnaðarfræði or "Software engineering at Reykjavik University". This is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns making the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game. If neither of the player wins, the game shows the message "Draw", to let the players play another game. If either of the player wins the game than it shows the message "Play again".
