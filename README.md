## Hugbúnaðarfræði - Late term project

### About this project
A simple Tic Tac Toe web application written in NodeJS.

### Why?
This project is not about Node or some other technology used in the project. It's about development best practices and practically using development tools to create a good, testable and **maintainable** code. Such as:
- TDD (Test driven development)
- Continuous integration
- Continuous deployment (using heroku)
- Git and the various workflows associated with git (we use branching wokflow)
